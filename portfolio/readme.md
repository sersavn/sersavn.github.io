## Idea

Using the following spherical cloud of tags, where certain tags will be highlighted based on data analyst/data scientist/ml engineer click (I am positioning myself as person capable of data scientist / ml engineer / data analyst job)

If you click on a skill inside sphere of tags you will be moved to the 'tag' you clicked and will be able to check all proofs that I am familiar with that skill

The rest of the portfolio will be hosted on the hugo paper mod


## Implementation

### Fork I.
1) Buttons "Data Scientist", "Data Analyst", "ML Engineer" -> After pressing the certain skills will be highlighted with green. After clicking on a skill another circular render will show up and it will consist of all Anki cards or concepts I am familiar in that topic. If you will click further -> you will see concept itself
2) Area to upload job requirements in .txt -> After pasting requirements overlapping skills will be highlighted with green and missing skills will be added and highlighted with red. After clicking on a skill another circular render will show up and it will consist of all Anki cards or concepts I am familiar in that topic. If you will click further -> you will see concept itself
*I decided to go with 2)

### Fork II.
1) Window where text can be pasted:
2) Icon where file can be uploaded:
*I decided to go with 1) for now

How do you rate my idea on a scale 1 to 10?
What do you think it is best to do with the skills that will be missing?

### Concept I.
- Before job description upload all skills are white
- After job description upload -> skills that matches are green, Missing skills are red 
Skills that I have on top of the skills in the job description upload are blue

## Q
- If it will be possible to host it on the github pages?
- If I will host that on github pages -> if the .js will be executed?
- How I can use intermediate script to process the data pasted in the *job_description* (how more complex it will be if I will use .py script?)
